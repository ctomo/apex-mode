# Apex language mode for Emacs

This mode provides syntax highlighting and code formatting for the salesforce Apex language.
To use this mode, put the `apex-mode.el` file into your Emacs lisp load path e.g. `~/.emacs.d/lisp/`
and add the following to your `init.el` file:

`(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")` 
`(require 'apex-mode)`
